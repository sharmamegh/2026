# 2026

This repository is my attempt to be a **consistent developer throughout 2026**.

The goal is not to ship one large product immediately, but to show up regularly, think clearly, and build deliberately, even if the daily progress is small.

## The project

The primary project developed in this repository explores a simple but real problem:

> How can developers share meaningful work publicly when most of their real-world work is confidential?

The platform focuses on documenting **thinking** rather than source code — capturing problems, constraints, decisions, trade-offs, outcomes, and learnings without exposing proprietary details.

## Why this repo exists

- To build consistency without burnout  
- To create public proof of work without violating confidentiality  
- To grow as a developer through reflection and iteration  
- To contribute something genuinely useful, not performative  

## How this will evolve

Progress will be incremental.  
Some days may add code, others may add ideas, structure, or documentation.

Consistency matters more than scale.
